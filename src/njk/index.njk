  <p>This website is dedicated to the British rock band formed in the 1970s known as Queen. Queen's earlist music was influenced by rock and hevay metal. However, over time the band transfomed their work to incorporate styles such as pop rock. This allowed for the band to become more radio-friendly. About 50 years since their debut, Queen has still managed to hold a special place in the hearts of many..</p>
